/**
 * PlaceholderElements can be used to represent elements in code matchers templates and code templates. They represent
 * variable elements in ASTs.
 *
 * Code matchers recognize portions of ASTs, while code templates generates portions of ATS.
 * For example, in a code matcher we could use a PlaceholderElement to indicate that a certain part of an AST could vary
 * and that we want to recognize that value. We could have an AST of this type:
 * SumExpr(PlaceholderElement("left"), IntLiteral(1)). A code matcher could recognize all of these expressions as matching:
 * SumExpr(IntLiteral(2), IntLiteral(1)), SumExpr(ReferenceExpression("foo"), IntLiteral(1)), or
 * SumExpr(MultiplicationExpr(IntLiteral(2), IntLiteral(3)), IntLiteral(1)).
 * What would vary among these cases would be the value recognized for the PlaceholderElement.
 *
 * Conversely, in a code template the PlaceholderElement indicates where to insert parameters provided to populate the
 * template.
